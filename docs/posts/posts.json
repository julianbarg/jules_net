    "contents": "\nOver the years, I have definitely learned not to ask too many questions—some,\nbut not too many—and go with what works. The problem with not asking\nquestions, or accepting that there is no good answer, is that you have to\nremember your workarounds.\nSometimes, it is easier to go with the original bash or python implementation\nof a tool, which Rstudio graciously accommodates. R reticulate calls a python\nvirtualenv for you, which is fairly easy to work with. To make sure I could do\nthe same things when calling python directly and when going through reticulate,\nI usually open the virtualenv directly.\nThe python environment of R reticulate is definitely… heterodox… I could\nmake API keys available through the virtualenvirons activate file, and those\nwould be available both when calling python directly and when using reticulate.\nHowever, reticulate does not play nicely with regards to PYTHONPATH. The\nPYTHONPATH variable defines where python looks for packages, so important when\nyou try to write a function in one project that you want to be available in\nanother package. For example because the function exceeds the scope of your\nproject, so you separate it out. Usually, you would just append your new path\nto the PYTHONPATH with a simple bash one-liner in the activate file:\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:new_path\". I don’t know why I have to use a\nrelative path there, but I’m not asking questions… That’s a whole other mess.\nFor some reason, reticulate takes it upon itself to manage PYTHONPATH for you.\nThe relative path is not relative to your home directory, but relative to your\nproject. The workaround? Modify the PYTHONPATH in your .Rprofile file. That is\na file that gets loaded at the startup of any R project. I use it to hold keys\nand set global options like options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE). Would have never\noccured to me to manage stuff that is relevant to python there. Google certainly\nwas of no help for figuring this out. But ChatGPT somehow knew.\nSo there you have it. The solution is to set\nSys.setenv(PYTHONPATH = \"/your/absolute/path\") in .Rprofile. I’m not going to\nask any more questions.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nI have been using OpenAI a lot over the last couple of weeks, and one issue that keeps tripping me up is their disjointed and incomplete documentation.\nThe documentation for their new vision API is ok, although it beats me why with the new beta I have to call completions.parse to accomplish what I want to do: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision . An example for using a base64 encoded image in bash/curl would be welcome.\nThe documentation for setting a seed is the worst: https://platform.openai.com/docs/advanced-usage/reproducible-outputs . The title is “Reproducible outputs,” so it’s not even the first result when we search for seed. Then you follow the link and get a tiny text snippet with not much information. There is finely one code example that you only find with ctrl+f. But it’s python only, and it is not clear whether it is available for bash/curl, too. I could never get it to work. There is one more example here that is way longer than it needs to be: https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/reproducible_outputs_with_the_seed_parameter .\nAnd then there is Structured Outputs, which is a new feature. Understandably the documentation is not as “good” as it is for the other features. First, there is a blog post announcing the feature: https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/ . The blog post is not intended to be a tutorial, but it does contain some basic examples. That tutorial would be here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/introduction . It is fine, but it is again not clear to me whether there are any limitations when using bash/curl. The tutorial also recommends the use of BaseModel to create a schema with ease. But there seem to be a lot of features one can only achieve by creating a custom JSON schema. It is appreciated for quick trial and error though. And finally, there is this cookbook entry, which does not seem to add anything: https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/structured_outputs_intro . So the time might have been better spend on creating a more detailed documentation on what features of JSON schemas are and are not (yet?) supported. I would certainly want to know.\nAnd this is not even touching on the quality of their error messages, which, at least for curl, usually amounts to “Computer says ‘No!’”\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nWe have this unfortunate problem that we want to create a sankey diagram, but\nmost of the existing packages are not feature complete enough. ggsankey is a\npopular solution, however, the sankey diagrams it produces leave much of the\nspace unused when working with a large dataset and there are no customization\noptions to change this. Then, there is the networkD3, which is actually just an\nR wrapper for the D3.js JavaScript library. Again, it inserts a lot of white\nwhitespace and there are only some basic customization options.\nFortunately, I came across ggalluvial, which makes much better use of space.\nTechnically, that is because it makes different assumptions about the data.\nAn alluvial plot tracks changes of attributes across subjects over time, whereas\na sankey diagram is designed to track track quantities. Because of this\nunderlying assumption that there is a change of state between a and b, not a\nflow from a to b, we retain more control. For example, we can to some degree\ncontrol attributes such as color even after we have already gone from a to b,\nfor subsections of the cohort in b. The underlying data structure of a sankey\ndiagram does not typically track observations across different stages, so there\nis no means of controlling attributes such as color once the train has left the\nstation.\nHowever, the inner workings are still a mystery to me, so let’s run some tests\nto see how this whole thing works.\n\n\n\nBasic example\nAs you can see, the number of variables we need is quite high. x and y are\nquite straightforward.\nx is simply a ordinal variable which denotes the\naxes.\nstratum then denotes that value of the observations on that\nparticular axis.\nalluvium allows for tracking observations across the\naxes.\ny allows us to set a count.\n\n\nalluvial <- tribble(\n  ~x, ~stratum, ~alluvium, ~y, ~label, ~fill, ~flow,\n  \"first\", \"high\", 1, 35, \"high\", \"red\", \"yellow\",\n  \"second\", \"high\", 1, 35, \"high\", \"red\", \"yellow\",\n  \"first\", \"low\", 2, 5, \"low\", \"blue\", \"pink\",\n  \"second\", \"low\", 2, 10, \"low\", \"blue\", \"pink\"\n)\n\nalluvial %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, stratum = stratum, alluvium = alluvium, fill = fill, y = y)) +\n    geom_flow() +\n    geom_stratum() +\n    geom_text(aes(label = label), stat = \"stratum\")\n\n\n\nThe geoms do not respect the colors we selected for fill, so we have to go in\nand fix that manually with scale_fill_manual. Still, this allow us to set\nthe color for flows and strata manually and independently.\nReordering flows\nOne awkward attribute of this data structure is that the factor order of the\nfactor variable stratum controls the order of variables across axes, so\nmanagement of the factor levels is important and awkward.\n\n\nalluvial %>%\n  mutate(stratum = factor(stratum, c(\"low\", \"high\"))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, stratum = stratum, alluvium = alluvium, fill = fill, y = y)) +\n    geom_flow(aes(fill = flow), color = \"black\") +\n    geom_stratum() +\n    geom_text(aes(label = label), stat = \"stratum\")\n\n\n\nJoining observations\nWe can merge different observations and then have them split off again.\nImportantly, this impairs our ability to set colors. Notice how medium is\ncolored in in red, even though there should be blue in there, too. So the much\nbetter option is to use stratum directly to control fill.\n\n\nalluvial_merge <- tribble(\n  ~x, ~stratum, ~alluvium, ~y, ~label, ~fill, ~flow,\n  \"first\", \"high\", 1, 35, \"high\", \"red\", \"yellow\",\n  \"second\", \"medium\", 1, 35, \"medium\", \"red\", \"yellow\",\n  \"third\", \"high\", 1, 35, \"high\", \"red\", \"yellow\",\n  \"first\", \"low\", 2, 10, \"low\", \"blue\", \"pink\",\n  \"second\", \"medium\", 2, 10, \"medium\", \"red\", \"pink\",\n  \"third\", \"low\", 2, 10, \"low\", \"blue\", \"pink\"\n)\nalluvial_merge %>%\n  mutate(stratum = factor(stratum, c(\"low\", \"high\"))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, stratum = stratum, alluvium = alluvium, fill = fill, y = y)) +\n    geom_flow(aes(fill = flow), color = \"black\") +\n    geom_stratum() +\n    geom_text(aes(label = label), stat = \"stratum\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\" = \"blue\", \"red\" = \"red\", \n                                 \"pink\" = \"pink\", \"yellow\" = \"yellow\"))\n\n\n\nJoined observations are treated as the same object if they share start and end\npoint after joining.\n\n\nalluvial_distinct <- tribble(\n  ~x, ~stratum, ~alluvium, ~attribute,\n  \"first\", \"high\", 1, \"long\", \n  \"second\", \"medium\", 1, \"long\",\n  \"third\", \"medium\", 1, \"long\",\n  \"first\", \"low\", 2, \"short\", \n  \"second\", \"medium\", 2, \"short\",\n  \"third\", \"medium\", 2, \"short\"\n)\n\nalluvial_distinct %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, stratum = stratum, alluvium = alluvium, fill = stratum)) +\n    geom_flow(color = \"black\") +\n    geom_stratum() +\n    geom_text(aes(label = stratum), stat = \"stratum\")\n\n\n\nThat is a problem when we want to show in geom_flow any variable other than\nthe variables to the left and the right. We can use the fill argument to do\nso, but we will need to use the after_stat function to make sure it’s\ncolored in correctly.\n\n\nalluvial_distinct %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, stratum = stratum, alluvium = alluvium, fill = attribute)) +\n    geom_flow(color = \"black\") +\n    geom_stratum(aes(fill = after_stat(stratum))) +\n    geom_text(aes(label = stratum), stat = \"stratum\")\n\n\n\nReordering\nWe need to figure out what determines the order of the inflow and outflow into\nthe same stratum. Can we manipulate this somehow without changing the stratum?\n\n\nstratum_control <- tribble(\n  ~x, ~stratum, ~alluvium, ~attribute, ~label, ~trick,\n  \"first\", \"high\", 1, \"high\", \"high\", \"high\",\n  \"second\", \"wide\", 1, \"high\", \"wide\", \"wide-low\", \n  \"third\", \"wide\", 1, \"high\", \"wide\", \"wide-low\", \n  \"first\", \"low\", 2, \"low\", \"low\", \"wide\",\n  \"second\", \"wide\", 2, \"low\", \"wide\", \"wide\",\n  \"third\", \"wide\", 2, \"low\", \"wide\", \"wide\", \n)\n\nstratum_control %>%\n  mutate(stratum = factor(stratum, c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"))) %>%\n  mutate(attribute = factor(attribute, c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"))) %>%\n  mutate(trick = factor(trick, c(\"wide-low\", \"wide\"))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, stratum = stratum, alluvium = alluvium, fill = attribute, \n             label = label)) +\n    geom_flow(aes(stratum = trick), color = \"black\") +\n    geom_stratum(aes(fill = after_stat(label))) +\n    geom_text(stat = \"stratum\")\n\n\n\nFabulous, with this trick we can control flows independently from\nthe axes.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nI’ve learned my lesson. This time around I am writing a blog post about all the\nidiosyncrasies. As the title says, it’s a POS and I am surprised that more than\n10 people were able to configure it successfully and use its many amazing\nfilters. It’s truly a bag of cats.\nInstall methods are abound, but they are not made equal\nThis is not pandoc-specific to be fair.\nVia package manager\nMost packages from package managers are at least a year behind. Even debian\ntesting is offering up a version that is 10 months old. To be fair, I could\nbuild a more recent version and contribute that to the repository. Maybe I will?\nVia .deb from the project github\nThe .deb is recent, it seems like a solid choice. But the last time I tested it,\nI could not get it to play nice with pandoc-crossref because of the way it was\nbuilt. Not that that’s the maintainers fault. There is just so many ways to\nbuild it. Mostly because there are so many different versions of latex that\ncould be used. Like, lualatex, xelatex, pdflatex etc.\nVia cabal\nAnd then you can built it yourself. It is written in Haskell, you can obtain the\npackage via cabal. I forget how slow it is, every time. It runs on a single\ncore. Apparently you can use the flag -j to run it in parallel. Well, I am not\ngoing to reinstall it just to test that.\nEvery. Single. Time. I install it via sudo cabal install pandoc, try to run it,\nand then realize that it cannot be found. You also need pandoc-cli to actually\nuse it. But it symlinks to ~/.cabal/bin. Which is not in your path. Not a big\ndeal. But so annoying. And it’s not like you get any helpfull error messages.\nThe bin cannot be found. Technically true, but then where did pandoc-cli go?\nI thought I just installed it.\nFilters are inconsistent\nThere are filters for pandoc. They are amazing. They can do anything. I like the\nlist-table filter to create tables in yaml syntax that are easy to edit and have\nmeaningful diffs. You can even adjust col width etc. However, there are two\nways to call them and the outcome is not the same. The docs often us --filter\nbut there is also --lua-filter. What’s the difference? I am not quite sure,\nand the error messages you receive when you use the wrong one are not helpful.\nSome lua filters work with --filter, for instance the fantastic\ninclude-files.lua, which is equivalent to \\include or \\input in latex.\nThe list-table.lua filter isn’t so kind. I am not sure the creator anticipated\nthat I would accidentally (?) call it via --filter because instead of\nreceiving a meaningful error, I received a version error. Making matters worse,\nsometimes I would receive a permission error, which could be addressed with\nchmod +x – but then the filter still would not work.\nArguments are inconsistent\nArguments can be provided to filters in a variety of ways. Some access command\nline arguments. Others want metadata, which can be added at the top of the\nmarkdown file as a yaml header. But you can also set defaults and store those in\nthe user directory. Finally, pandoc-crossref (if memory serves me well) wants\ninput arguments to be stored in a separate input yaml file. It could access some\narguments when they were stored in the metadata. But not all of them. The\nflexibility is great, but it makes for an awful debugging experience.\nLua is obscure\nIf you need to, you can edit any lua filter to your liking. They are not too\nlong, so you will usually be able to find the relevant rows. However… pandoc\nwith lua relies heavily on classes and… I have no idea where to find the\nrelevant classes. Sure, you can google them. But there are code blocks, fenced\nblocks, and maybe a third one? I could never figure out in which order they are\nprocessed and what I needed to return. (You can include code blocks in fenced\nblocks but not the other way around? So if you have a package that uses code\nblocks, just change the filter to turn them into fences if you want to do\nsomething with them?) Making matters worse, there are multiple\nequivalent ways of inserting images/figures, and I could never figure out where\nto look up the relevant objects to determine what I need. And neither could\nmany contributors, because what I have seen across packages seemed inconsistent,\nand I did not fare well when trying to mix and match.\nTo be continued…\nThere is so much more I am forgetting.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nInteresting events playing out at the moment around German tanks for Ukraine. Here is my interpretation. Pure speculation, I don’t have more information than anybody else. And absolutely no revising of this text, this is just going to be pure flow consciousness.\nSo several European countries would like to send German Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Germany is apprehensive, and needs to approve any exports. Now, previously the German government had been secretive about weapons exports to Ukraine a couple of times, denying that they were going to send weapons until after the fact. In this specific case, tanks are a–perceived or real–red line that the German government did not want to transgress. A previous example were missile defense systems, and before that multiple rocket launchers like HIMARS.\nThe funny thing is, now other European countries–particularly Poland–make it appear as though Germany’s hands are tied. They suggest that they may export German tanks without permission from Germany. Now let’s imagine for a second that tanks are a real red line, that some member of the Russian government has told some member of the German government that if Germany was to approve exports of German tanks to Ukraine, something would happen. Then the current situation would be sidestepping the red line on the basis of a technicality–“but we did not approve those exports!” Knowing that the German government likes to stage weapons deliveries as not happening, it would not be unthinkable that this whole situation is completely orchestrated. And my best guess is that if Poland exports tanks without permission, the German government will quietly approve those exports after the fact. Regardless, the fact that Poland is driving the current debate–respect, the Poles are punching massively above their weight. Everybody expected the US or Germany to make the calls, but Poland is sneaking up on the world stage.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nMLI states its goal as making “poor quality public policy in Ottawa\nunacceptable”. Its news section shows no clear line, but a clear\nconservative bias. According\nto their own report the Macdonald-Laurier Institute (MLI) recruits\nindigenous people to “create free-market change”. Its network acts as “a\nshield against opponents [to] allow Canada’s Indigenous population to\nbenefit from mining and energy development”. One header in particular\ncaught my attention: the “lack of indigenous data available”. At least\nwithin universities, data collection would take place only after\nextensive consultation with indigenous groups as data is essential to\npower and control and can easily be abused. But of course MLI has\nindigenous memebers within its ranks, so the situation is not quite\nblack and white. The bottom line is–is MLI problematic because the\norganization is an industry allie, or is it problematic because it\nsupports values that I disagree with?\nSo what is problematic about MLI according to the report? I will go\nthrough the issues raised in the article one by one and discuss how\nthese talking points could inform research.\nHayden King of the Yellowhead Institute calls the campaign “a\ncontemporary expression of the type of imperialism that Indigenous\npeoples have been dealing with here for many, many years”.\nWhile I would agree with Hayden King, I do not think that deferring\nto an authority in an area is a particularly good route for\nresearch.\nMLI has ties to Atlas Network and refers to Atlas Network for\nquestions. Atlas Network has numerous problematic ties, for instance to\nthe Cato Institute. Atlas Network has also received at least $1m from\nExxonMobil and over $700,000 from the Koch Family Foundations.\nDo not get me wrong. I think it is highly problematic how much\nindustry money is foating around (see also Barley 2010). It is obvious to me and\nyou who are in the know that these ties are problematic. But most people\nare not in the know, so the goals of all these organizations need to be\nindividually established. In the case of MLI, we are talking about\n“second order ties”, so are the goals of the problematic organizations\npresent here, too? Or maybe any ties to industry money are problematic?\nOne possible coures of events is that MLI was looking for funds–like any\nthink tank or NGO–and Atlas Network was happy to fund MLI as their goals\nwere aligned. That is not the same as MLI receiving marching orders from\nAtlas Network. So again, the story is getting more complicated.\nMLI and Atlas Network have been pushing back against the\nimplementation of the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).\nAgain, not cool. But this is an issue of action or content, not\ncontext. We would again be deferring to an authority, in this case the\nUN, to establish that MLI is not a legitimate organization. Does being\nagainst a policy render an organization inherently problematic? As\nsomebody who is interested in social movements, I do not hope so.\nMLI board members have problematic ties to industries and lobbying\nfirms.\nThis is a promising starting point. The article does not list the\nties, but this point suggests a potential course of action. What\npolicies do MLI members promote during the day and what is it they do at\nnight? Researching specific actions and statements made by individuals\ncould yield interesting insights.\nAtlas painted their collaboration with MLI on UNDRIP as a success\nand also mentions first nations organizations such as the First Nations\nMajor Projects Coalition as supporters. A spokesperson of the First\nNations Major Projects Coalition disputes this.\nMisleading statements such as these are highly problematic. Industry\norganizations are quick to list first nations organizations as their\nsupporters where e.g., only a consultation took place. These kinds of\nmisleading statements always require a lot of ancillary research from\nresearchers.\nThe rest of the article mostly talks about UNDRIP and its importance\nfor indigenous communities in Canada.\nGreat insights here. Of course this is again content or action\nrather than context. So it looks like we cannot dodge the great debates\non policies, even when we face off against potential industry shills or\ntrolls.\nTwo important notes here regarding money and goals. There is very\nlimited data regarding the flow of money from and to organizations such\nas the Atlas Network–these kinds of information leak once a decade\nmaybe. By the time we receive these information, the damage has already\nbeen done. Considering the size of the network, the specific sums\nmentioned here are also not very impressive. Not even two million\ndollars, and that money was flowing to Atlas Network which is then maybe\noffering grants or prize money after paying its own employees. How does\nMLI pay the salaries for its dozens of fellows? The foundation has its\nown money for that. On the other hand, what if these $2 million are just\nthe tip of the iceberg, and we were to learn ten years from now that\nAtlas Network had maybe $50 million in funding? And what if we learned\nmore about MLI’s goals from leaked internal emails ten years from\nnow?\nIndustry money floating around is a problem, especially since\nenvironmental grassroots do not have access to the same kind of\nresources. The question is how to convince an audience today\nthat this is a problem? The most promising way is hard work focusing on\nspecific issues. For me, learning about the ties between MLI and Atlas\nNetwork is helpful, but it is only a starting point, not an end point.\nWe still need to do the legwork of looking into people and issues.

    "contents": "\nSome time ago, I looked into the environmental impact statement of a few pipelines, including Keystone XL. In hindsight, it seems a bit silly to start there. Fossil fuel projects are not analyzed in isolation, they have to be viewed in their political and historical context.\nThere has been a lot of talks about European imports of fossil fuels from Russia, as if the decision to import those fossil fuels had been blatantly stupid. These import decisions though have not been made in a market situation where “demands are met”. The fact that local pollution from natural gas are lower than those from other sources is also only a convenient side effect.\nOne important piece to those specific trade relations between Europe and Russia is the “Ostpolitik” of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Their “Ostpolitik” included the deliberate dialogue and creation of ties with the Eastern Block–which included the import of natural gas from the Soviet Union.\nThe US’ official energy policy goal is “energy independence”. Subsidized American fracking at a loss are be the counterpart to European imports from Russia.\nTo think that we draw on specific sources of fossil fuel because it is cheap or greener than others is at least an incomplete assumption. The historical context is more complex than that. And looking at the historical context is also a great starting point for identifying the power relations that one is up against when seeking to reform the energy business. To just point to environmental benefits is also incomplete and in many cases insufficient for making a change.\n\n\n\n",

Would have loved to see this story discussed more widely. 50 steel executives jailed for faking emissions data. It was somewhat of an open secret in China that firms would fake their emissions data. What are you going to do if not reaching your goal is not an option? As a response, China implemented a mandate that data would be send live from the source (sensors at the smoke stacks from what I understand) to the regulator. Now, even if a company wanted to fake their data, there is a high chance that there would be some discontinuities in the data when they change over from one data source (sensors) to another--a computer generating random data. The Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a Beijing-based NGO, has some of the data, which is very cool.\n\nSo now some inconsistencies were found and people went to jail. Now I am wondering: who should go to jail for corporate environmental crimes? Environmental fines are often seen as the cost of doing business. I think it is fair to say that jail time for environmental crimes is rare, especially in countries like the US where corporations are more and more becomming persons, and executives have less and less personal responsibilities. Before I start discussing punishment on the body through imprisonment rather than on the organization, I should probably revisit Foucault's Discipline and Punish. But I think this warrants a debate. Serial polluters--people, not organizations--are a pest and I will hold onto that fragment of hope that they can be removed from industries.",

    "contents": "\nToday I heard of the RCMP’s Community-Industry Response Group (CIRG): https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=23&languageId=1&contentId=66492. Well, I probably heard of it before, but it came up again in relation to the recent RCMP crackdown on the Gidimt’en checkpoint on Wet’suwet’en territory where a journalist was placed in custody four three days. I thought that was a good reason to review the situation.\nI was very surprised by the response of the police: within a few days of erection of the checkpoints, they flew in a large group of RCMP officers who arrested everybody indiscriminately. This was during a historic flooding of British Columbia and of course the pandemic. Kind of an all hands on deck situation. Of course the operation also took place in the Northern part of BC where infrastructure is sparse and logistics can present a challenge. The existence of CIRG explains this. CIRG can mobilize officers to “[address] energy incidents and related public order, national security and crime issues.” In other words, cracking down on energy protesters and coordination with TC Energy is part of their job. CIRG would also be in charge of collecting intel on indigenous protesters and monitoring relevant developments.\nThere guys are without a valuable resource to the energy industry. Imagine having your own dedicated office at the police! These would also be the guys who employed “lethal overwatch”–which may or may not be a euphemism for snipers–when they cleared the Gidimt’en checkpoint in 2019. I am sure they achieved the psychological effect they were hoping for. See also here for an interview with the arrested journalists: https://breachmedia.ca/an-inconvenient-image-arrested-journalists-reflect-on-rcmp-assault-on-wetsuweten/\nIt may be relevant to compare these events to the Battle at Standing Rock between indigenous protesters and Energy Transfer Partners, who employed both the police and private security forces. If TC Energy did not have CIRG at their disposal, they would probably need to retain a private security company both to monitor the situation on a continuous basis and to be sure that personnel can be a deployed on short notice. TC Energy probably still retains one, but the scope of that contract is likely smaller, translating to direct savings.\nThe possible next step could be direct cash transfers from TC Energy to the police. That is a system that eventually emerged in Minnesota: https://theintercept.com/2021/02/10/police-minnesota-enbridge-pipeline-ppe/ . Originally, for cash-strapped police departments to offset the cost that arose from protecting work on Line 3. The downside is that that system seems to incentivize police departments to accrue as many billable hours as possible. And being harassed by the police is significantly more unpleasant than to be harassed by a private security force.\nI think there were three factors that allowed for Energy Transfer Partners to prevail in the battle against indigenous protesters: (1) the use of a scrupulous paramilitary private security firm that employed veterans from Iraq. (2) Coordination with the police, giving the combined force much more punch. (3) The decisive use of force. In particular, many protesters described the psychological effect that the use of dogs had on them. TC Energy seems to need much less to keep the upper hand in the Wet’suwet’en territory, but they can always escalate things if they need to. There is no significant private security to speak of because CIRG has the situation under control.\nWhat will happen next? The indigenous protesters seem determined to keep the checkpoint going, despite the arrests that already happened. To ensure the successful construction of the pipeline, the RCMP would have to pretty much permanently arrest the group until the pipeline is complete. Which they might now be willing to do, because of the backlash they may face for that. Or TC Energy might need to increase their own security forces.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nSo after failing with Keystone XL, TC Energy (formerly TransCanada) is now working hard on its Coastal Gaslink Pipeline. The Coastal GasLink Pipeline transports fossil gas in a liquid state rather than oil or oil sands. But it adresses one of the same challenges that Keystone XL meant to tackle: the difficulty of cutting through the rockies and the Fjords of the British Columbia Coast. British Columbia is also unique in that about 95% of the area is unceded territory, meaning that no contracts were signed when Canada colonized this territory. In the same breath, these territories are also often described as being stolen–a pretty accurate description. Since TC Energy couldn’t be too picky with their route, it should come as no surprise that some conflicts arose.\nI have been reading up on the events that transpired so far on Twitter and other websites occasionally. So I just got a glimpse of the events. But there is so much there that I now felt the need to write it down, lest I forget.\nOf course TC Energy knows the laws on indigenous consultation, and in this case, too, indigenous communities were formally consulted and agreements were reached. One curiosity though is how the indigenous communities in BC are organized. Since most of the land is unceded, reserves only make up for a small fraction of indigenous territories. Reserves have formal indigenous governments, but participation in the elections is negligible–in that context the Indian Act is often cited with slowly eroding “formal” membership numbers. And then there are the unceded territories outside of the reserves. These often have the formal status of “Crown Land”–however, the Supreme Court of Canada has begun recognizing that indigenous people have at least some rights over there lands. Which indigenous people though?\nThe elected governments of the reservations only have jurisdiction over the territory of the reservation. This is a system that was imposed on the indigenous population. Outside the reservations, indigenous people are organized like any informal community is: loosely. Clans are families, and they are neighbors. Less than 200,000 First Nations lived in British Columbia–on an area that is larger than Germany and France combined. That means that indigenous people are not a “member of a clan” in any abstract sense–they are aunts and uncles, cousins and second cousins. And another clan is an important neighbor rather than any abstract external “government entity.” On the other hand, some indigenous people are also formally organized as bands under the Indian Act. The 2014 transfer of a Crown Land land title in a different part of BC to the Tsilhqot’in by the Supreme Court of Canada also adds to the uncertainty around indigenous identity and formal jurisdiction.\nIn some of the regions which Coastal Gaslink Pipeline would cross, indigenous communities came together–as families and neighbors, but also as activists–and reached an agreement: they would not allow TC Energy to stand. Take a couple of extended families, and their neighbors a couple miles over, and their extended families–and you end up with a couple of hundred or thousand indigenous people unequivocally opposed to the pipeline project. In this specific case, these couple of thousands are members of indigenous communities that do not live on the reserves and were not consulted by TC Energy during the planning process for the Coastal Gaslink Pipeline. They would also not benefit from whatever funds TC Energy has allocated to recognized indigenous governments (compare to and contrast with Suncor 2021).\nNow the twist: these are Crown Lands we are talking about, who has the authority to speak for First Nations there? Not the reserve governments–their jurisdiction ends at the border of the reserves. The bands? Maybe, but if that is the case, which band should be given the right to exert which authorities over which lands? The indigenous communities involved in these events also have matrilineal traditions which were superseded by the Indian Act. The matrilineal tradition may be a better representation of how the clans are organized, although in practice it is more complicated than that.\nThis is what happened so far: on January 5, 2020 the Wet’suwet’en issue an eviction notice to Coastal GasLink contractors (Dryden 2020), signed by 8 hereditary chiefs. A BC court issued an injunction against this order only two days later, which TC Energy now uses to legitimize its continued work. Regardless, on November 15, 2021, the Wet’suwet’en decided to enforce the eviction order by erecting a checkpoint and blocking the only access to the area (Wilson 2021). Only a few days later RCMP members were flown in by the province during a historic flooding. The Gidimt’en checkpoint was raided and the hereditary chiefs arrested in a pretty gruesome fashion–after the raid, a member of the press was held for four days and three nights (Bracken 2021). Undeterred, when the Wet’suwet’en members were released, they reoccupied their site and continued their eviction: https://twitter.com/gidimten/status/1472644113434513409\nWhat is notable is the evolution of indigenous resistance at play here. The Wet’suwet’en no longer use the language of indigenous tradition and cultural practices, but assert their rights using the language of law: an eviction order is executed. In conjunction with the legal challenges that Crown Land in BC faces, there is an interesting question here. Will these just continue as inconsequential language games? Or is this a form of institution building, growing out of an evolved indigenous identity? The events may pose a challenge to the previously untouchable Canadian institution that is the fossil fuel industry. Coastal GasLink has already been delayed, and TC Energy seems “weakened,” for the lack of a better term, after the Keystone XL defeat.\nThe literature would speak of deinstitutionalization, but I see this rather (or in addition) as potentially a new institution emerging, in response to the challenges posed by an existing institution or institutions to a population. Of interest is also the hereditary chiefs’ identity. Whereas the reserves and elected band officials support the pipeline, the hereditary chiefs stand united in opposition. Of course there are the financial incentives that hereditary chiefs are excluded from, but there is also their unique, historically-culturally rooted identity.\n\n\n\nBracken, Amber. 2021. “Opinion: Press Credentials Didn’t Help Me Against the RCMP in Wet’suwet’en Territory.

    "contents": "\nAbout two weeks ago, atlas ti web (“cloud”) fatally crashed while I was using it. Frankly, atlas ti is an unstable piece of crap and I want my money back, so I jumpted on the opportunity and got serious with taguette, with a good line as to why I am using an unestablished software for my research. I kept notes on the experience with the intention of filing a few tickets on things that would benefit the user experience, but they got so extensive that I decided to take down my thoughts in this document, too.\nBased on performance alone, taguette is off to a very good start. My experience with atlas ti desktop, nvivo, and maxqda is limited, but I have heard my fair share of complaints from colleagues. I tried them all, briefly, and I was not impressed–Dedoose in particular was a disaster. Then again, some of it comes down to the fact that I am a linux user, and I am just not serviced by these companies–sure, I could run a virtual machine, and I did use wine to test some of them. On the other hand, I assume the experience is not much better when you use them natively. The UI, the user experience, it’s clunky.\nWhere is taguette’s potential niche? I don’t see taguette gaining native support for PDFs any time soon–which I thought would be the killer feature for atlas ti web–so I think taguette should play into it’s strength, which is responsiveness. Seeing as all data requests in taguette are handled through SQL, I think maintaining taguette responsive shouldn’t be too much of an issue–not that SQL requests cannot be messed up by bad coders, so I am assuming some level of competence here.\nWhat should taguette be striving toward? I think the reason why QDA softwares have not caught on more widely–why should only qualitative researchers be using the software, and why only once they reach the data analysis stage?–is that the user experience is not great. I am reminded me of how clunky Mendeley felt when I did anything that it was not intended for (and what it is intended for is really only, only the word plugin). In comparison, once I had set up Zotero, settled on Okular, and had all the plugins set up–it is a piece of software I actually like having open all the time on my second screen just to grab the papers I need. I am not talking about Zotero’s UI, what I hope taguette could do is give you fast, convenient access to your qualitative data and just allow you to focus on your analysis.\nTo some degree, that kind of user experience for scientific research is about getting out of your way and giving you freedoms. The approach of making your data relatively accessible through an easy to find SQL file–that is also interoperable with other FOSS QDA software–is just right for that purpose. An obvious role model with a similar approach to separating software, UI, and data is jupyter, and I suppose taguette has already learned a thing or two from that project anyways. In my opinion, taguette could never learn enough from jupyter lab–that’s a software I always enjoyed starting up and looking at my data in.\nI don’t want to get too much into it, but there is probably a further argument to be made about learning from the jupyter project’s goal of easy iteration, sharing, and collaboration (Shen 2014). Maybe a long-term aspiration could be to assist both the qualitative work itself, to also give users the best means possible to share their results, and to allow collaborators and the audience to retrace if not reproduce the results. I am not quite sure what that would look like. Part of it is the option to output codes and coded document in easily accessible data formats–taguette already has plenty of these options. Another element is probably to enable the slicing and dicing of the qualitative data and codes. A third element would be collaborative coding and checking for intercoder reliability. Taguette is already partway there for that last one–just like I can host jupyter lab for my organization on a server, I can also imagine hosting taguette and giving my collaborators access to that–in fact, I am thinking about adding that to my server right now, it would be a nice supplement to my wiki, which I often use to share notes and early drafts. I have learned R, Python, bash and some SQL over the last four years–it does not seem to unreasonable for me to learn some Java, too, and help make some of that happen eventually.\nBelow is the list of observation that I created from my notes. Roughly in order of priority. It is an entirely unfiltered list, so there are some pretty miniscule things on there, and some stuff may be inaccurate where I did not double check? The fact that it’s quite a long list does not mean that taguette is inherently flawed–I did really enjoy using it.\nDisplay the document name above the document.\nProvide an option to search all documents in a project or globally.\nProvide a dedicated scrollbar for the documents in the project (left sidebar) or a different mechanic–I noticed that when wanting to scroll through the documents in a project, I would need to scroll to the bottom of the document first. At first I thought scrolling was broken when I was in a very long document, before I tried using ctrl+end. Makes for an awkward experience with long document+long list of documents–I have to jump to the end of the document first and then scroll up rather than just scrolling down to the document I am looking for. The obvious alternative would be for scrolling to move both content+sidebar together at first until the end of the sidebar is reached. Another one is the current solution for smaller screens–placing the sidebar above the content.\nDocument overview page for all the documents in a project–this view could offer features for filtering documents to find exactly what you are looking for, e.g., filter by name.\nAlso related to point 3, but admittedly a lot of work: make the two elements–Document list and document contents–independent. When clicking on a document on the list, really only the document contents should be refreshed. That would allow for the users to quickly go through a couple of documents to find what they are looking for. Let’s say I have three documents and I am not sure which one contains the section of interest: currently, the way to find out is to scroll down, click, look at the document, scroll down the document list, click and check again, and repeat one more time.\nVary colors of highlights–this becomes important when the user tags two successive paragraphs. I think there are a lot of ways for going about this. Either, taguette could progress through some pleasant color palette, back and forth? Or (random?) contrast colors could be used? Or the palette could be linked to the tags. It should be consistent when repeatedly opening a document though.\nIn the highlights rider, provide an option to add tags to an existing highlight with tags, e.g., when showing all highlights for one tag. This and te following couple of suggestions are related to the work step of refining and consolidating existing texts in inductive studies.\nProvide an option to combine tags for filtering in the highlight rider.\nProvide an option to merge two tags into one.\nWhen clicking on the name of a document in the highlight rider, go to that specific highlight in the document after loading the page.\nAutomatically jump to the name field when clicking on “Create a tag” in the Highlight window.\nAutomatically open the Highlight window when highlighting a section of text–seriously, what else am I going to do?! Joke aside, there would still need to be an option for copying the text, but that is 1 time out of 100 times I highlight a section of text.\nThe prior change would render this redundant, but when highlighting a section, the “new highlight” pop-up/button should really appear near the mouse pointer, not at the end of the highlighted section. Scrolling up while highlighting a section sometimes means that the “new highlight” button is out of view at the end.\nSearch for tag by name when creating or changing a highlight (rather or in addition than the current checkbox approach)–this could speed up the workflow of tagging significantly. Highlight a section, the window pops up, user starts typing, ideally there would be some kind of autocompletion, meaning I only need to press enter after a few letters and can then start typing the next tag.\nWhen I create a new tag from the Highlight window, it should automatically be selected (the box ticked).\nAllow for more than one column in Highlight window–not having to scroll through the tags always allows me to have muscle memory pop in as I remember the position of tags. Especially appreciated when using the same tags very often.\nWhen adding a document, it should probably be opened.\nDrag-and-drop documents in addition to the “Add a document” button.\nShow tags on hovering over the highlight without needing to click on it.\nWhen the highlighted section ends at the very right of the screen, the highlight button sometimes is partially off the screen. Up to 50% of the button might be covered by the end of the screen–obviously not a serious issue, but still something I noticed\nProvide an option to create a copy of a project with all highlights removed (e.g., to recode or to allow multiple researchers to code a project separately).\nProvide an option to export a project.\nDark mode.\nAn option to sort tags in the highlights rider by recently used–I find when I create a new tag, I tend to forget it after five minutes, and only after I have used it a couple of times do I remember the tag. Would be great to be able to look up the tag I just created, or the tags I used most recently, as opposed to being swarmed by tags i haven’t used in ages.\nAllow for longer file names–my naming system is context-date-time-title(the last one being optional) sometimes when adding a title I go over length. This one is at the very bottom because it’s important\nSometimes, when opening a document from the highlight rider, the document itself will not open–although the other documents do–and the user has to reopen or reload the page\nThis one is really purely a QoL and probably not worth the work, but it would be great for taguette to remember the last position the user was in when closing a document, and for it to return to that section when the document is opened again\nNow, I admit this is just straight up sci-fi. But I dream of a day when taguette uses integration with a pdf reader to handle tagging pdf documents. Zotero does that well–but the task is much easier for Zotero since it is intended for opening documents externally. What I have in mind is something like the old version of Okular which used to save annotations in a separate .xml file.\nI know I am going wildly off-topic now, but I wish taguette stole shamelessly from jupyter labs and that it may become a mashup of all the best features of the established QDA softwares (with none of the performance issues).\n\n\n\nShen, Helen. 2014. “Interactive Notebooks: Sharing the Code.” Nature 515 (7525): 151–52. https://doi.org/10.1038/515151a.\n\n\n\n\n",

Bourdieu (1977) shall serve as an illustrative and comprehensive example. His study on the society of Algeria works its way up all the way from the micro to the macro. The foundation of his analysis are common words and phrases used in Algeria, and their rationales. He then works his way up to describe the relationship between these words and phrases and common power structures in Algeria–most notably between a bonded person and the master. Bourdieu’s constructivist stance does not preclude the analysis of nonsocial factors (that are of course still only accessed through social means, i.e., ethnographic and archival work). The seasons take an important role–they primarily influence the activities that Algerians pick up and put to rest throughout the year. The rarity of money necessitates the accumulation of symbolic rather than economic capital.\nHow does the literature describe institutions? In the OT literature, the institution is a convention for talking about a specific context. Note that many of the classic works in sociology, including Bourdieu (1977), do not typically hone in on a specific institution. Rather, Bourdieu uses “institution” as an umbrella term for “myths, rites, or bodies of law, or […] co-ordination” (Bourdieu 1977, 79) that have come to be taken for granted, but barely ever names a specific institution. In the OT literature, we typically move in a world that is the aggregate of a countable number of specific institutions (this is admittedly a bit of a hyperbole). Sociologists such as Bourdieu move in a space that consists of many overlapping and interrelated conventions. Some of these conventions are so complex and ingrained that should be considered institutions. To define thresholds or boundaries would defy the spirit of that literature.\nWhat is the institution in my context? There are many things in my context that have become to be taken for granted. Because of their taken-for-grantedness, they often are most visible in retrospect–when their taken-for-grantedness has lapsed. The oil industry itself is an institution–says The Guardian: “The fossil-fuel industry’s aura of invincibility is gone” (McKibben 2015). The approval of construction permits had been taken for grated–says World Oil: “Keystone XL shutdown may signal the end of major U.S. oil infrastructure” (Freitas, Adams-Heard, and Gilmer 2021).\nPipeline safety had been institutionalized, but in a more “regular” fashion. The safety of the pipeline post construction is strictly kept out off the agenda in state-level meetings and hearings. While right-of-way is handled at the state level, pipeline safety is regulated at the federal level. In practical terms, this means that states are not allowed to make decisions on pipeline permits based on the anticipated safety–or lack thereof–of the pipeline. This division of roles is enforced vigorously. Possibly because TransCanada’s lawyers have advised the authorities in charge that it will sue if there is any indication of bias based on pipeline safety issues? This I should investigate further, possibly in interviews.\nThe government is also an institution, one that is enforced quite viciously. This point is more salient with the Dakota Access Pipeline but also present in the case of Keystone XL. Where there is an indication that protesters may circumvent the government and take it on themselves to block the construction of the pipeline there are both responses that take advantage of existing regulations–think trespassing–and there are actors that take it upon themselves on enforcing the institution and countering any threat from protesters on a level that goes beyond their job description. Many local police offices go out of their way to assist TransCanada.\nSometimes, the lines between institutions are blurry. In the case of the Dakota Access Pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners often compensated police departments–a lucrative deal for cash-strapped rural police departments. TransCanada has also been assisting police departments with “intel” on specific protesters. And independent of Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline, the American Legislative Exchange Council has successfully “shopped around” a model bill to states–the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act–which introduces severe punitive measures against protesters that trespass on energy facilities such as pipelines (ALEC 2018; Kaufman 2020). In the US, information on the exact location of pipelines is only accessible for government officials, pipeline operators, and contractors, meaning that protesters can unknowingly trespass on this infrastructure. The bill highlights the blur or network that can emerge between institutions.\n\n\n\nALEC. 2018. “Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.” American Legislative Exchange Council. https://www.alec.org/model-policy/critical-infrastructure-protection-act/.\n\n\nBourdieu, Pierre. 1977.

    "contents": "\nThe currently dominating Maguire and Hardy school of discourse has a strong focus on the “officially sanctioned” version of discourse–conferences, dockets, and official comments. They have made invaluable contributions to the literature. There are now established methods for discourse analysis. The theory of institutional processes has advanced significantly since their early contributions (Hardy and Phillips 1999). We now understand that institutions limit what actors can say in a discourse (Maguire and Hardy 2013)–conversely, it could be said that exactly this limitation constitutes the institution (Maguire and Hardy 2006). Their contributions have illuminated the “wiggle room” that exists with regard to what can be said by whom, and how it allows for institutional entrepreneurship (Hardy and Maguire 2010) or deinstitutionalization (Maguire and Hardy 2009).\nAnd yet when we inverse the central question, we are none the wiser: what cannot be said by whom, and why? Taken-for-grantedness is not exclusively a passive process–it is often actively enforced–albeit in a subtle manner (Steele 2021). Where we rely on the official version of discourse, we miss out on this facets: the processes that keep unsanctioned statements out of the official discourse; state-sanctioned actions to suppress statements; and efforts to shape the official discourse before it has even begun.\nThe following are some examples for illustration. (1) In an official meeting of the Nebraska Natural Resource Committee between the legislature, TransCanada, and the Sierra Club, the participants celebrate the latest decision to reroute Keystone XL and conduct a state-funded Environmental Impact Assessment. Senator Mark Christensen presses for Ken Winston of the Sierra Club to abide by the new status quo and cease resistance against the new route, since the demands of the Sierra Club were met (NRC 2011). (2) A public hearing on Keystone XL in Nebraska. A majority of participants seems concerned about the issue of pipeline safety. All questions concerning pipeline safety are rejected, since it is a matter for a national agency (PHSMA). (3) Following the President’s decision to revoke the permit for Keystone XL, TransCanada files a claim with the NAFTA arbitration in the amount of $15 billion. (4) Although indigenous groups make for some of the most persistent opponents of Keystone XL, their voice is rarely heard in the official discourse. Many of their claims revolve around treaty rights–the relevant authority is the national government. (5) Ahead of planned protests in Montana, governmental agencies create a “joint terrorism task force.” A police department vows to stop the protesters “by any means.”\nThe last example might seem far removed from the current debate on discourse and institutions–yet it is ironically the closest to Foucault’s original work (Foucault 1977). The control of the body is one of the central motives of his works–it is what constitutes the power in discourse. Discourse without the power to enforce is not discourse–it is just words that will probably vanish. The literature on discourse needs to consider what cannot be said by whom and why.\n\n\n\nFoucault, Michel. 1977. Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison. 1st American ed.

    "contents": "\nAny paper discourse usually begins with Foucault. Or at least drops a reference to Foucault fairly early. Or starts by referencing a work that itself begins with Foucault. In other words, you cannot get around Foucault if you talk about discourse. And rightfully so. Foucault is the undisputed king of discourse. Nobody can draw you as deep into a far away episteme as he does. And nobody showcases the transitions between discourses–usually in the form of abrupt change or departure–as well as he does. The way he packs some three hundred centuries into some two hundred pages is impressive, all while doing justice to each included discourse. I can only begin to imagine the effort that went into his works, to select the discourses and materials to include–limiting the scope–seems like an insurmountable task: making an arch work while optimizing on episodes and materials.\nThis is a long way of saying that Foucault has a specialty. And this specialty is baked into his legacy–discourse analysis as a method. If the scope of your work is similar to that of Foucault–spanning centuries–certainly his is the only way to go about it. But there are different ways to get at epistemology. Like Goffman, we can learn about epistemology by observing everyday life. Goffman’s approach may not yield us the “big picture,” but it still gives us a solid understanding of how frames–the counterpart to the Foucauldian discourse–operate in everyday life.\nThe scope of the phenomenon should decide the method, just like the phenomenon should be selected based on the question. On a Foucauldian scale–spanning centuries–discourse may be the only lasting explanatory factor. Where our work covers less ground, the noise becomes louder–and starts to dominate. Microinteractions affect or determine the sequence of events–and these are largely absent from Foucault’s work (Collins (1990) via Power (2011)). In other words, to understand how discourse drives the contemporary lived experience, e.g., of an institution, a discourse analysis needs to be conjoined with an analysis of events at a more micro scale. Foucault may have structuralist tendencies–as he alludes to himself (Foucault 1970)–but that should not preclude the analysis of institutional actions when talking about events of a smaller time scale.\n\n\n\nCollins, Randall. 1990. “Reply: Cumulation and Anticumulation in Sociology.” American Sociological Review 55 (3): 462–63. https://doi.org/10.2307/2095770.\n\n\nFoucault, Michel. 1970. “Foreword to the English Edition.” In The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences, ix–xv.

    "contents": "\nMark suggested something unexpected to me on Monday. Unintended consequences of action are an important them in Gidden’s work (e.g., Giddens 1979). A more recent iteration can be found in MacKay and Chia (2013) and is also featured–as unexpected outcomes–in Leibel, Hallett, and Bechky (2018), because it is such an important outcome of discourse and institutional processes over a meso time scale. What are unexpected mechanisms? Take for example Guérard, Bode, and Gustafsson (2013). The authors track how diesel particulate filters gained legitimacy in the German car industry. Of course one could first of all object by saying that at the point where French automakers had rendered the filters financially viable, further opposition was pointless. But the Volkswagen emission scandal highlights a different, more nefarious pathway–in the same industry, but regarding a different car part. For catalytic converters in diesel vehicles, too, the German car industry after a long period of resistance had also signaled that it would yield. Mercedes had shown that it could be done–but that it would be expensive. VW opted to develop its own solution–and famously cheated the test to meet legal requirements. VW’s public presentation of the employed technology gave no indication of the deceit, and what was going on behind the curtain–of course. At the surface, the new catalytic converters had attained legitimacy, and VW had acquiesced. In reality, VW utilized an avoidance strategy (Oliver 1991). The unexpected machanism is deliberate decoupling.\nAn unexpected mechanism could be many things. Most importantly, the above is an example of an unexpected mechanism that is entirely internal. Many unexpected mechanisms are external, for instance when an organization chooses a channel for action that the audience or adversary has not anticipated.\n\n\n\nGiddens, Anthony. 1979.

We have looked at atmospheric modeling used by the USEPA, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and others, and we found that these models are not reasonable for Project-level analysis for a number of reasons. For example, these global models are not suited to determine the incremental impact of individual projects, due to both scale and overwhelming complexity. We also reviewed simpler models and mathematical techniques to determine global physical effects caused by GHG emissions, such as increases in global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, atmospheric forcing, or ocean CO2 absorption. We could not identify a reliable, less complex model for this task and thus staff could not determine specific localized or regional physical impacts from GHG emissions from the Project. Without the ability to determine discrete resource impacts, Commission staff are unable to assess the Project’s contribution to climate change through any objective analysis of physical impact attributable to the Project.\n(ibid. p. 11f)\n\nAlmost everything I have looked at with regard to pipelines and oil spills screams “we don’t know.” And whenever there was a “known known,” chances were it would be revised later.

    "contents": "\nAOM ONE is holding a plenary session under slogan “From Problems to Solutions.” I wanted to put down my thoughts on this. My first reaction is–based on where we are, I don’t think that direction is one that we can take? I think we are squarely in a “solution” period, problematization is missing in action. I also see a parallel to sustainable development vs. ecocentrism and similar subsequent debates (Gladwin, Kennelly, and Krause 1995; Ergene, Banerjee, and Hoffman 2020). One side jumps to the conclusion and presents a solution, implicitly assuming that a solution must be feasible. The other side seeks a focus on the environmental problems, usually with much less focus on the problems. These particularly stood out to me because another colleague recently said to me “if somebody comes to me with a solution, I am going to reject that article. I want to focus on problems.”\nI think it is a hard pill for some to swallow that a solution might not exist. Not because we are missing the technology or know-how, but because of the social system behind the problem. Ironically, to frame the situation as hopeless and to focus on problems might be the only way to give a social impetus for change. The sustainable development crowd might be missing the mark when it inspires hope, because that festers compartmentalization and complacency. But the belief behind it seems to be rather than complex analysis, the belief that “if we frame the situation as hopeless, people are going to feel disparaged, they are not going to act.” In my experience, the opposite is true. Those who seem the most cornered are the most avid fighters. Might just be an example of our model of the world at work, shaping our research. By the way, all this is not to say that we should orient ourselves back toward ecocentrism, I think we have moved past that.\n\n\n\nErgene, Seray, Subhabrata Bobby Banerjee, and Andrew J.

    "contents": "\nHere is the connection between discourse and legitimacy in brief. In the literature, it is a two step process. Research on institutions drives inquiry into discourse (Leibel, Hallett, and Bechky 2018). And within that literature, legitimacy takes an important or central importance in many of the works. Conversely, discourse analysis is one of the three methods mainly used in research on legitimacy (Suddaby, Bitektine, and Haack 2017). What does legitimacy mean to those authors? Where legitimacy is used, it constitutes or “replaces” the institution. When legitimacy is achieved, the institution is intact. When legitimacy is lost, the institution ceases to exist. Guérard, Bode, and Gustafsson (2013) is the clearest about this: “Before a social movement reaches moral legitimacy, it is unlikely that frame transformation will be effective because actors may perceive the movement as marginal […]” (p. 809).\nThe lack of detail on the mechanism here is a shame. Guérard, Bode, and Gustafsson (2013) features an unusually rich description of the dyadic interaction (which they call dualistic) of two actors: the German car industry, and various environmental organizations in conjunction with other nonprofits. The article’s use of the term “legitimacy” indicates that there are other relevant actors. Specifically, their findings indicates that there are one or two actors of importance. The government considers taking action, but decision makers get their cues from (perceived) public support. Legitimacy is of course a theoretical construct, and part of a model that aims to allow for a easier representation of the reality–which includes shaving off details. But Guérard, Bode, and Gustafsson (2013) also indicate that the government is a somewhat complex actor with its own networks and contingencies: one of the central claims that they make concerns the power that the car industry has over the government. This connection–the connection that constitutes power–is not further explicated on the basis of their qualitative data.\nThe further developments in the empirical context after they publish their article highlights that it matters who “provides” an institution with legitimacy. The emission scandal after the end of their observation scandal, which hit Volkswagen the strongest, shows that legitimacy alone was not enough to enforce a new technology, and government oversight fell short of what it should be–probably because of the power relations that the authors raise without detailing them. The dyadic relationship between the car industry and the government–let alone the public–is at least as complex as that between the car industry and activists. Other examples of the construct legitimacy being used to abridge a context–albeit to a lesser extend–include the work of Rao, Monin, and Durand (2003), Zilber (2007), and Ansari, Wijen, and Gray (2013), which otherwise is more or less faithful to the discourse taking place.\nIn contrast, consider the legitimacy-as-perception view raised by Suddaby, Bitektine, and Haack (2017). Located at the center of the approach is the idea that legitimacy lies in the eye of the beholder, be it an individual or collectives. In that view, it matters who attributes legitimacy to an institution. The question of audiences is widely discussed. For instance, an individual might hold a negative view of an industry sector, but still take this industry for granted–in that case, the institution is still intact. Specifically, that occurs when the individual is aware that her view diverges from the majority opinion. Vergne (2012) elaborates this point by differentiating legitimacy and stigma.\nThe concept of legitimacy as used by Guérard, Bode, and Gustafsson (2013) and others in the discourse literature embodies the tautology that is at the very heart of institutional theory. An institution exists if when something is institutionalized. When something is legitimized, then it becomes legitimate. To differentiate audiences is one first step toward clearing up the tautology. We can see the workings of the taken-for-grantedness when we understand who takes what for granted. Even better when that audience then becomes alive as an actor. The passive audience is a rare phenomenon: when an actor or institution acts on an audience–i.e., manipulates it (Oliver 1992)–there is bound to be a reaction.\nTo show the workings of this process, we do not need the legitimacy concept. We can achieve the same by showing who the audience is, and how this audience interacts with the institution. Legitimacy then is a useful metaphor to summarize the process, but it should not be used as more than a metaphor for something that is explicated elsewhere, unless legitimacy is a sideshow to the research. The empirical research on discourse and institutions meanwhile suggests that the audience is much less of a passive participant than frequently implied. It matters who beliefs what (to be legitimacy) because the audience does get involved. And even more than that, e.g., in contexts such as the American oil and gas industry, the line between audience, actor, and institution can at times be a very blurry one.\n\n\n\nAnsari, Shahzad (Shaz), Frank Wijen, and Barbara Gray. 2013. “Constructing a Climate Change Logic: An Institutional Perspective on the ‘Tragedy of the Commons’.” Organization Science 24 (4): 1014–40. https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1120.0799.\n\n\nGuérard, Stéphane, Christoph Bode, and Robin Gustafsson. 2013. “Turning Point Mechanisms in a Dualistic Process Model of Institutional Emergence: The Case of the Diesel Particulate Filter in Germany.” Organization Studies 34 (5-6): 781–822. https://doi.org/10.1177/0170840613479237.\n\n\nLeibel, Esther, Tim Hallett, and Beth A.

The bigger picture: [The Nothern hemisphere is sectored into alterning heat domes and areas of lower pressure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/07/20/heat-wave-northern-hemisphere/). The jet stream over the Northern Hemisphere is basically experiencing a traffic jam. The human costs are enormous. In some countries, problems are worsened by social policy. [For example, 3%  of the population of Portland is homeless!](https://grist.org/cities/portland-heat-wave-homeless-support/) Can you imagine? I like to think that Europe has a much smaller homeless population than America. But then again, in the further North you go, the less houses have air conditioning--things are not going well.\n\nI think about this as the _actual new normal_. Natural disasters are becoming more frequent, _that_ is the actual cost of climate change. Sure, we can clean up after one Hurrican Katrina. And California's economy somehow survived the 2011-2017 drought (more like 2011-2021 drought with temporary relief...). Are we going to start really struggling in a few years, when these events become a regular occurance? Wikipedia already has articles on the 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2018, and 2021 heat waves. When do these heat waves just become weather?\n\nIt is easy to overlook that places like Pakistan, South Africa, and Bangladesh are already struggling because of a double whammy of climate and policy failure. What other countries are going to be added to the list before the end of the decade?",

    "contents": "\nJust read Leibel, Hallett, and Bechky (2018). I few things stand out to me. First, how few papers there are in the area. They review 61 articles, including papers on discourse, rhetorics, and frames. Then, how little the literature concerns itself with dialogue and interaction–as opposed to statements that are issued and read by allies only. The insular nature of society media is reflected in our research. There is a lack of dyadic relationships, or, for the lack of a better word, networks. Not in a quantitative network analysis kind of way–that may in most cases just reinforce insularity–but in a very simple “who says what to whom, and what happens then” way. That is how insularity comes to be. How is it that the few times where A says something to X rather than B and C–A being similar to B and C but not X–it is so easy for X to dismiss that message? In a similar vain, the dearth of qualitative work in the area after the linguistic turn we supposedly have taken. Sure, quantifying discourse language is convenient, but on many of the big, important issues, the fronts are quite clear. For instance, interest groups such as indigenous people say what they think, with much clarity. There is no need to code the language just to decode it again. I don’t think the supposed hidden messages exist–the only thing that may be hidden away is part of the discourse, and it takes a good researcher to surface relevant documents (I know this conflicts with the previous sentence, leave me alone!).\nI do suspect though that there is some additional, older research–especially mixed methods with archival work and interviews–that could be interpreted as being concerned with discourse, but which lacks the clear methods section to make the link.\n\n\n\nLeibel, Esther, Tim Hallett, and Beth A.

I will gladly do that, and I agree that this represents a pathway to integrate institutions and older models of politics and power.\nIs there a tautology though in the potential findings? An institution exists when it is enacted by actors through social action. It ceases to exist when it stops being enacted by actors. That observation seems not to be very profound. The statement becomes a little less tautological when one includes the observation that others acting against the institution have a play in changing institutions.

    "description": "The world is so small, at least when we're talking pollutants. PFAS, or \"forever chemicals\" are a group of substances that is associated with numerous superfund sites in the US, many of them related to manufacturing sites that were operated by the military. I swear I read an excellent lengthy news report about one of those sites before which laid out in detail the suffering of the current residents--most of them minorities (of course...). Cannot find it anymore unfortunately, but it seems there are many stories out there. [Turns out, some fracking chemicals form PFAS as a side product.|https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/climate/epa-pfas-fracking-forever-chemicals.html] That's not where the story gets interesting though. The interesting part is that the EPA knew since 2011, but failed to follow up. And that this issue has been revealed through a FOIA request by Physicians for Social Responsibility. The group does a great job at unveiling concerning developments, in an investigative journalism fashion. The takeaway is something I had in my mind for a longer time. (1) The EPA is not (always) on your side. (2) FOIAs are THE most important tool in our toolbox to shape discourse toward protecting humans and the environment. And (3) to make a positive impact requires an enormous amount of resources and patience. Many agencies fight tooth and nail to prevent a release of information. To obtain information, one frequently needs to follow up with the court, and be willing to go all the way to the Supreme Court. Only an organization that has significant financial resources and personnel continuity can succeed in pursuing an issue like that. And the number of organizations like that in the US can probably be counted on ~10 hands? I think that's why its so easy for relevant information to go unnoticed, and for corporations to get away with polluting for extended periods of time.",

I assume that there is an internal rule to include that paragraph in every post--which, as we know, almost definitely makes it true. You just have to say it often enough. Anyways, their approach is very interesting--back some moderate positions and then throw your weight behind pipelines. They are expressing support for offshore wind, but also Line 5. So if we were to write the playbook--if you want to do astroturfing right, don't just create radical organizations. Sure, with those you can get the Trumpers.

TransCanada stands out, negatively. \"Holland estimates that there are more than 50 pipelines crosing his property.\" First of all, wtf? He even lost track of the exact number? That guy must be living somewhere near a major terminal or sth I assume. Also, yes, that is where your food comes from (if you are American). To be fair, I have a couple of farmers in my family, and yes, people don't really know where their food comes from. It's mostly not great. And if people did know, they probably wouldn't like it. But I am getting distracted. What stood out to me was that out of all those pipeline operators, TransCanada is the one that will not allow the farmer to move heavy equipment over the line. Which is a problem if you are a farmer and the line runs 2 miles across your property. So maybe some of the challenges that TransCanada encountered do stem from the fact that they are lacking experience in the US and made some enemies with their behavior?",

They said they became afraid to even take walks through their neighborhood.\" The dilutans include some known carcinogenes, so I expect the cancer rate to go up in the long term, and there are probably going to be a couple of premature deaths. Yet were supposed to believe that when it spills into the ocean, it is just processed by hydrogen-degrading bacteria an that's it? Also, the case highlights again the regulatory capture of the PHMSA, which for five years blocked all efforts to obtain documents on hearings etc. Despite the fact that these information on exactly what was spilled are obviously very important to the poisoned families.",

Cause they have such a great track record on developing technology. They built like 10 wind turbines and a solar park somewhere, I'm sure. To use in an ad, and abandon the year after. I am not even exaggerating--[renewables made up for 0.8% of capital investments of oil firms in 2019, despite being a popular theme in ads of ExxonMobil, BP, and the likes](https://earthrights.org/blog/big-oil-dumps-billions-into-misleading-advertising-campaigns/).\n\nAn interesting offshoot of that thouht is wheter technology isn't more valuable for the oil and gas industry in its current shape of being the perpetual future. Think about it: now that its still the technology of the future, the theme can be used to raise funds, and oil companies can point at it and say \"oil and gas is fine!\" That is a much more comfy situation compared to building carbon capture and storage sites and discovering that it is not that simple, or cheap, or reliable in keeping the carbon in.

But in this case I would not mind being wrong: [Michigan wants to shutdown a poorly maintained pipeline connection across the Great Lakes to Ontario](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-line-5-pipeline-a-ticking-time-bomb-must-be-shut-down-by-next-week/). As [I have mentiond before, I have my doubts about pipelines actually being shut down](https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2021-04-29-once-the-pipeline-is-there-its-not-going-anywhere/). And the shutdown of a pipeline--even if it is a \"ticking time bomb\"--would certainly be surprising from a state that [only last year experienced a dam break of a dam that was known to be dangerous for years](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/thousands-fled-their-lives-when-two-michigan-dams-collapsed-more-n1230841).",

    "description": "[So Biden allows the Dakota Access Pipeline to keep operatings, despite it having no Environmental Impact Statement](https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/article/14202049). I am not too surprised. Why should you still care? One of the most intriguing thing about studying pipelines is this: the construction of pipelines as our mode of shaping the world. In German there is a term for that: \"Fakten schaffen\"--\"creating facts\". Implying that while your counterpart still contemplates about what action to take--or even before that stage, you take action, do something, anything. The intent being that by just by acting first, you get to decide, you get to take your preferred action. A fitting example would be buying an expensive car before consulting your husband or wife. Nothing you can do about it now, the contract is already signed! \n\nIn 2017, the Trump administration waived the need for a full environmental review for the Dakota Access Pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners managed to build the pipeline within Trump's tenure. The story that follows is pretty convoluted, [a court ordered the pipeline to be shut down while the environmental review is completed](https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/article/14180097), [another court overturned that order before it went into effect](https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/government/article/14179644), and the Biden administration now confirmed that DAPL can keep operating. What I am getting at is that academia is speding a whole lot of time contemplating things while the world keeps moving. While we study the environmental effects on one ecosystem, two more have already fallen victim. I think there is a lot of merit to analyzing the world as a burst of decisions that flow from our social structure, rather than contemplating about the ins and outs of individual decisions.",

I did not realize that not only did Trump rubberstamp Keystone XL (which was later undone by Biden), but he also kneekapped the environmental reviews for pipelines in general. Not sure whether that was later undone by Biden. [To do so he relied on a trick that the Republicans already attempted in Congress when Obama was still president--although Obama called their bluff](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/us/state-dept-to-put-oil-pipeline-on-hold.html). The rule he introduced states that the Department of State has 60 days after an application is received to collect information on the basis of which the president then makes a decision. Since not a lot of information can be collected in 60 days, this makes it easier for the president to rubberstamp such applications. As a side note, Obama's response back in the days was to deny the application, stating that not enough information could be collected to confidentially determine whether the project is in the national interest.",

    "description": "I just had an epiphany on what my current work is actually about. Not the stilted academic version, but the explanation in layman's terms. There are three elements. Obviously, as always, I am focusing on environmental pollution. The second broad area is that of decision making, and the illusion of rationality. But right now, with my work on pipelines, it is much simpler. While reading the [testimony of former TransCanada employee and whistleblower Evan Vokes](https://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/former-transcanada-engineer-warning-to-residents-south-of-the-border-dont-trust-transcanada/) (what a name, eh?), I realized how much there is actually on the record on social action leading up to big, collective decision making, and how much of it I have seen or read in the past, particularly with regard to the oil & gas industry. And that is the kind of stuff that should be on record in the academic literature. We do not have to guess as to the underlying reasons of corporate action & communication. We certainly should not *always* hesitate to speculate about their intentions, and assume some kind of rational optimization at the aggregate level. At the surface, the discourse seems oriented toward environmental safety, but it really does not need a lot of scratching to reveal a lot more complexity.",

[Here is another story about expropriation in the US](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/22/byhalia-pipeline-memphis-black-landowners). Sure, the US will never date nationalize your company or put any significant tax on your riches--but they will take it for the benefit of corporate profits. What great progress. The usual modus operandi for the construction of pipelines, as with many public works in the US, poses a justice issue: like with highways in the mid-century, property value are a factor for deciding where to build pipelines. Guess which neighborhoods are usually poorer and have their propert value assessed at a lower level? So African-Americans, who are already disadvantaged, have a harder time building up any wealth because if they buy real estate at lower value in an African-American neighborhood do not get the same returns on their investments that the European immigrants get. Chances are, they will even lose a significant share of their money.

Mike Rowe, television host of *Dirty Jobs* gets sponsored by the API to make a show about history--cynically titled *Six Degrees*. Shout outs to the oil and gas industry galore. Not only that, but he will gladly defend his connection to the industry on Facebook--writing 6,000 words, free of charge to the API presumably. I believe Emily Atkin hits the nail on the head when she observes that this is not a guy selling out his believes--this is a guy who genuinly beliefs what he is saying. A far more weighty observation. Here is my take on this. He has made a show called *Dirty Jobs*. The implication is that \"it's a dirty job and somebody has got to do it.\" \"It ain't pretty, but we need it.\" Do we though? It seems he genuinly beliefs it, and he thinks those who disagree with him are naive. Is it naive to envision an alternative future though? In my opinion its not, it is far more naive and unimaginative to see the reality we live in as inevitable. *Alternativlos*--without alternatives--as we say in German.

    "description": "Today I have been looking at software for qualitative data analysis, and it is quite disappointing. The feature set that I would be hoping for of course is quite extensive, that is probably part of the reason. It should be (1) FOSS, (2) actively being developed, (3) available on Windows, macOS, Linux, (5) able to import text documents, PDFs, and ideally html files, (6) capable of importing highlights and notes from PDFs, (7) save its data in a convenient form, for instance as an SQL database. But it seems outside of Atlas Ti and NVivo there isn't much going on.\n\nRQDA is really janky, but at least it saves its data as an SQLite database. QDAP only works with text data. Cassandre's website looks... sketchy... Of course Atlas Ti uses SPSS under the hood, which only makes sense if you are being developed by the same software (just a guess, I don't actually know). And it cannot import websites, only if you have already saved them to PDF. And NVivo straight up doesn't have a Linux client (you could probably run it in wine, but that's not the pont) AND requires NVivo to be installed on your system for you to be able to launch its browser version. What a dumpster fire. \n\nSo the way I see it, you can do two things. Either organize your material yourself, but I think getting all the crossreferences into a discourse would not be feasible without taking way too much effort. Or you can think short term and run a project on Atlas Ti. I am sure they won't be at the top of the pack in ten years, so that's a pity. Won't be able to migrate your data out, either. I am now trying to organize as much as possible outside of software, before importing stuff as the last step. But the fact that you cannot even import the annotations that are already saved to a PDF document--so annoying.",

Last week I was thinking that it would be easier to just collect links and post them once a week. That kind of fails, because I never got to the \"once a week\" part. That's where the second benefit of this style of blog that I am aiming for comes in. Writing a note should only take me five minutes--then it is something I can do 2-3 times throuhout the day. Any polishing and it is going to throw my day off to much. Writing a post is also a great day to get the day started--knock something out right away.

The interesting question is whether Enbridge told the police to go all-out or whether police offices took the initiative and what we observe is a revenue-generating strategy by the police forces. My sense is that it did not require much communication for this situation to occur if Enbridge and the police are on the same page on this issue anyways. Another aspect: the first example in the text is a woman getting fined for failing to signal more than 100 feet before a turn. That police strategy we have all seen before: pull over a member of a group that you don't like--if you know the law well enough you will always be able to fine that individual for some obscure infraction.

Because it is an attractive place for the chemical industry to be, where you can have your [chemical plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Fertilizer_Company_explosion) [blow](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/27/783263942/massive-explosion-rips-through-texas-chemical-plant) [up](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-harvey/harvey-danger-how-toxic-air-texas-chemical-plant-explosion-n797876) [without](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chemicals-fire-tpc-portneches-idUSKBN1Y80HH) [significant](https://www.cnn.com/2014/04/22/us/west-texas-fertilizer-plant-explosion-investigation) [repercussions](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/03/30/arkema-disaster-harvey-regulations-texas-crosby/). The EPA there is a toothless tiger: it will help you clean up and communicate with the public that they are safe, but they do not actually have the resources--or legislation--in place to prosecute the perpetrators.\n\nThe problem with having the chemical industry concentrated there is that the world is facing a [shortage](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/polar-storm-paralyses-us-gulf-coast-petrochemical-sector/4013306.article) in [certain plastics](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/polar-storm-paralyses-us-gulf-coast-petrochemical-sector/4013306.article). Not that I am a fan of plastics in the first place, but I do appreciate the irony. Lax regulations have led to the location of much of the chemical industry in Texas, a weak preparation of said plants for disasters, and to the devastating blackouts. Something, something, economically unsustainable etc.",

    "description": "I think one reason for the American schism on covid is the lack of \"human-interest stories\" on covid, for the lack of a better term. I saw a lot of reports on the lockdown, people \"suffering\" from the mask mandate, etc. But relatively little on people suffering from covid, the doctors, nurses, etc. There is one new relevant documentary from the times accessible [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5BhuzqeDRU). It's probably not easy getting into a covid wing like that with your camera, so I appreciate the effort. And I also appreciate the perspective of what its like to battle covid in a less affluent community. Great stuff!\n\n**Edit**: I forgot to mention, I am somewhat sure that one reason for the dearth of more personal covid content is Youtube's restrictive policy. I remember at least a handfull of creators mentioning that merely saying the c-word can lead to their video being demonitized. I understand that the policy was put in place to tackle desinformation, but it would be interesting to see in how far it has also done a bit of the opposite. My intuitition is that a nurse or patient suffering from covid would go either to youtube or to twitter to document their fate or make a plea to others. Now the only way to get on youtube and reach a sizable audience is to have an official news team by your side. Of course there is also the fact that many of the sickest cannot talk or comment on their fate at all.",

To install packages in sublime--and the packages are really the killer feature--you first need to install thepackage manager. Turns out, [if you place the package manager file in the sublime folder, sublime will install the package manager automatically on startup.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19531651/8963109) And then you can also place a file with your installed packages in the settings folder, and sublime will install these for you too. Why this matters? It means you can set up a new machine with something like ansible, for instance installing sublime with apt, and then a simply get all your options with curl, and your machine is ready to go, but also has everything installed from scratch.",

What forests don't like are high temperatures, droughts, and extreme weather. All of which we had plenty of in the recent past. So maybe its not all that surprising that the German forest is in a really bad shape. So bad that [German Spiegel writes that the German forest is \"dying\"](https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/wald-in-deutschland-noch-nie-sind-so-viele-baeume-gestorben-wie-2020-a-5233254c-b79e-4f8e-83c3-de50b2349ef4). Only 21% of trees have an undamaged crown, the lowest number ever recorded. A surprising cause of this decline: monoculture. Many of Germany's forests aren't all that natural. They have been created, e.g., to serve the early mining industry many centuries ago. And of course for that purpose (or whatever other purpose) you would only plant whatever kind of tree serves you best. So bark beetles are having a blast right now.",

The fact that Texas could not import electricity is the result of Texas seceding from the national power grid with the aim of evading federal rules– to “deregulate”. That’s probably also why state regulations do not require operators to prepare for extreme weather. The system does apparently also include a sizable share of renewable energy (at least for American standards), but of course wind turbines were not winterized, just like the rest of the system. Texas previously experienced a similar weather-related outage in 2011 and I suspect since Tucker Carlson somehow managed to blame everything on renewables, nobody will feel compelled to make any changes and we will see similar outages again in the future.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Quick announcement by the IEA--[solar energy is now the cheapest energy in history](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/solar-cheap-energy-coal-gas-renewables-climate-change-environment-sustainability). The announcement certainly marks a significant turn for the IEA. But it will probably not come as a surprise to those of you who have watched solar power mature. I think the trajectory was there for a number of years. I remember the resistance against renewable energy veiling itself in a dress of economics, but in retrospect it seems incredible how little forward looking that resistance was, even in economic terms.",

    "description": "Today I was thinking to myself 'emission certificates on the EU ETS seem pretty cheap, we could just buy those in heaps to force the prices to go up'. So I did a little bit of digging around and found [the great _Compensators*_ project](https://www.compensators.org/en/compensate-2/) by the even more amazing _Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research_ (PIK). Their website makes it pretty easy to buy emission certificates, either by unit or by price, any fraction possible. At currently 41.52€, still a steal. Although I still remember prices being in the 20s. Well, prices going up is a good thing in this case I suppose.",

The most important point though is certainly that we should not assume or hope that technological change will in the future make our current lifestyle more sustainable. I do not see the value in trying to preserve everything *as-is*.",

This [...] explains more of the right's hostility to climate action than a naked story of enjoying checks being cut by the American Petroleum Institute\" ([time stamp: 5:54](https://youtu.be/f1rxv1yPQrc?t=354)). For context, Jerry Taylor started his career about three decades ago at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which today has gained infamy for [shopping around anti-protest legislation](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-louisiana-lawmakers-stop-residents-efforts-to-fight-big-oil-and-gas), [with great success](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/)!

Shapiro and Walker (2018) have disaggregated CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NOx, VOCs, and CO emission in the US from 1990-2008 by industry, location, facility, and product. They find that during that time period, emission reductions are driven not by technological change or trade, but by more stringent regulations. The cost of complying with these regulations in 2008 amounted to an implicit pollution tax equal to ~1.1% of total production cost–double the value in the year 1990.\nOther works in this discourse include Keiser and Shapiro (2019), Isen, Rossin-Slater, and Walker (2017), Deschênes, Greenstone, and Shapiro (2017), Shapiro (2016), and Fabra and Reguant (2014). (1) Keiser and Shapiro (2019) finds that cost of clean water legislation amounts to ~0.8% of GDP per year, but that these legislations have effectively improved water quality in the US. They also criticize the lack of research on water pollution in the economics literature. (2) Isen, Rossin-Slater, and Walker (2017) determine through a quasi-experiment (regression discontinuity) that lower levels of air pollution in the early childhood improve labor market performance in adults. (3) Deschênes, Greenstone, and Shapiro (2017) uses an instrumental variable design. Some counties have no power plants which emit NOX–and hence exhibit no NOX pollution in summer. They find that reducing NOX emissions by one million tons per year will save about $0.5 billion in medication expenditures, and prevent 3,100 premature summertime deaths (which economists value at $2.1 billion…). (4) Fabra and Reguant (2014) finds that power companies fully pass through the cost associated cap-and-trade programs to consumers via electricity prices in the absence of proper market design. All of these works are impressive and change the way we think about pollution.

The problem with using new software is that a lot of the features I desire are not there yet. In this case, I got a little bit too impatient maybe and went on github to report issues, and make feature requests. Since resources are limited, a lot of my reports have not been picked up yet, but one was. Being an early adapter is always a challenge, and reporting issues is part of that. On the one hand, I don't want to ask too much from open source developers. On the other hand, feedback from early adapters is what open source developers need in order to know in what direction to go. So it's some neat feedback for me to see that one of my reported issues became part of the (milestone 1.2 for R distill)[https://github.com/rstudio/distill/milestone/2]. I hope as a user I am contributing by reporting issues, and not just being a pain for the developers.",
